this is statemod example dataset 0-4b
this is the fourth network dateset for the example 0 series
  of statemod data sets
example X.Y means the example X series, the Yth version

# this dataset is the same as 0-4a, except added an ISF
# within the exchange reach to call it out
#
# this dataset can successfully estimated baseflows to an xbm file
# using the example-0-4b-b rsp file
# and can successfuly run in simulation mode with example-0-4b.rsp
#
# the example 0 series has a network that is fairly small and simple,
#   but complex enough to host various kinds of structures later,
#   and has enough variability to be good for testing
# drawings of and notes about the network can be found in the series
#   of files with names like example-0-4b-doc.*
