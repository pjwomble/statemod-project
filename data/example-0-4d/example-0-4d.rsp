# StateMod Response File for example 0-4d
#
# this is the fourth network dateset for the example 0 series
#   of statemod data sets
# example X.Y means the example X series, the Yth version
#
# this dataset is the same as 0-4c, except added a new senior diversion
#   to cause a shortage in the right being split to an exchange
#   O R type 24  - testing what happens now in a shortage
#
# this dataset can successfully estimated baseflows to an xbm file
#   using the example-0-4d-b rsp file
#   and can successfuly run in simulation mode with example-0-4d.rsp
#
# the example 0 series has a network that is fairly small and simple,
#   but complex enough to host various kinds of structures later,
#   and has enough variability to be good for testing
# drawings of and notes about the network can be found in the series
#   of files with names like example-0-4d-doc.*
