# StateMod Response File for example 0-5c-b (-b for baseflow)
#
# this is the fifth network dateset for the example 0 series
#   of statemod data sets
# example X.Y means the example X series, the Yth version
#
# This dataset is identical to 0-5b except an new option
# for type 24 exchange is implemented (oprspill=-1)
# to prevent the rediversion problem demonstrated in example 0-5b.
# This option freezes the type 24 exchange results
# after reop step 1 (i.e. it does not call the type 24
# subroutine on subsequent reop steps).
#
# this dataset can successfully estimated baseflows to an xbm file
# using the example-0-5c-b rsp file
# and can successfuly run in simulation mode with example-0-5c.rsp
#
# the example 0 series has a network that is fairly small and simple,
#   but complex enough to host various kinds of structures later,
#   and has enough variability to be good for testing
# drawings of and notes about the network can be found in the series
#   of files with names like example-0-5c-doc.*
