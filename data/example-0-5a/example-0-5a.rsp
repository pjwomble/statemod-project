# StateMod Response File for example 0-5a
#
#this is the fifth network dateset for the example 0 series
#  of statemod data sets
#example X.Y means the example X series, the Yth version
#
# This dataset is similar to 0-5 (a direct exchange
# from the jr DD1 water right to an upstream acct
# plan (type 11) via op rule 24 with an upstream spill),
# except the exchange will split the right 60% to the
# plan and 40% left at the original structure.  Testing
# whether op rule 24 split works as expected.
#
#this dataset can successfully estimated baseflows to an xbm file
#using the example-0-5a-b rsp file
#and can successfuly run in simulation mode with example-0-5.rsp
#
#the example 0 series has a network that is fairly small and simple,
#  but complex enough to host various kinds of structures later,
#  and has enough variability to be good for testing
#drawings of and notes about the network can be found in the series
#  of files with names like example-0-5-doc.*
