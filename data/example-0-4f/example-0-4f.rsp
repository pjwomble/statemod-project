# StateMod Response File for example 0-4e
#
# this is the fourth network dateset for the example 0 series
#   of statemod data sets
# example X.Y means the example X series, the Yth version
#
# Modify 0-4e by changing the type 24 exchange to a type 39
#   alternate point of diversion, keeping the same structures.
#   Source (DD1WR2) is a water right serving a direct diversion
#   (DD1).  Alternate point is an upstream node (D2).  Try
#   mode 1 first - original right at original location is OFF,
#   the right can not divert at original location, only at the
#   alternate point.  Purpose is to test type 39 behavior.
#
# this dataset can successfully estimated baseflows to an xbm file
#   using the example-0-4f-b rsp file
#   and can successfuly run in simulation mode with example-0-4f.rsp
#
# the example 0 series has a network that is fairly small and simple,
#   but complex enough to host various kinds of structures later,
#   and has enough variability to be good for testing
# drawings of and notes about the network can be found in the series
#   of files with names like example-0-4e-doc.*
