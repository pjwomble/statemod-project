# StateMod Response File for example 0-5b
#
#this is the fifth network dateset for the example 0 series
#  of statemod data sets
#example X.Y means the example X series, the Yth version
#
# This dataset is similar to 0-5a (a direct exchange of 60%
# of the jr DD1 water right to an upstream type 11 acct plan
# via op rule 24 with an upstream spill), except added a large
# new diversion (DD2) with a right senior to the exchange.
# Located it upstream of DD1 at node C4. Testing whether
# op rule 24 works as expected.
#
#this dataset can successfully estimated baseflows to an xbm file
#using the example-0-5b-b rsp file
#and can successfuly run in simulation mode with example-0-5b.rsp
#
#the example 0 series has a network that is fairly small and simple,
#  but complex enough to host various kinds of structures later,
#  and has enough variability to be good for testing
#drawings of and notes about the network can be found in the series
#  of files with names like example-0-5b-doc.*
