this is statemod example dataset 0-5b
this is the fifth network dateset for the example 0 series
  of statemod data sets
example X.Y means the example X series, the Yth version

# Statemod example dataset 0-5b
# This dataset is similar to 0-5a (a direct exchange of 60%
# of the jr DD1 water right to an upstream acct plan (type 11)
# via op rule 24 with an upstream spill), except added a large
# new diversion (DD2) with a right senior to the exchange.
# Located it upstream of DD1 at node C4. Testing whether
# op rule 24 works as expected.

this dataset can successfully estimated baseflows to an xbm file
using the example-0-5b-b rsp file
and can successfuly run in simulation mode with example-0-5b.rsp

the example 0 series has a network that is fairly small and simple,
  but complex enough to host various kinds of structures later,
  and has enough variability to be good for testing
drawings of and notes about the network can be found in the series
  of files with names like example-0-5b-doc.*
