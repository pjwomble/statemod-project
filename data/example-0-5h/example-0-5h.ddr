# Example 0-5h
# example-0-5h.ddr;  Direct Diversion Right for StateMod Example 0-5h
#
# this is the fifth network dateset for the example 0 series
#   of statemod data sets
# example X.Y means the example X series, the Yth version
#
# This dataset is similar to example 0-5g except the type 27
#   destinations are changed from diversions to plans.
#   Testing to see if having all the plans on separate nodes
#   corrects the mass balance errors observed in 5e.
# 
# this dataset can successfully estimated baseflows to an xbm file
# using the example-0-5h-b rsp file
# and can successfuly run in simulation mode with example-0-5h.rsp
# 
# the example 0 series has a network that is fairly small and simple,
#   but complex enough to host various kinds of structures later,
#   and has enough variability to be good for testing
# drawings of and notes about the network can be found in the series
#   of files with names like example-0-5h-doc.*
