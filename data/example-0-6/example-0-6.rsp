# StateMod Response File for example 0-6
#
# this is the sixth network dateset for the example 0 series
#   of statemod data sets
# example X.Y means the example X series, the Yth version
#
# this dataset is the same as 0-4, except deprecated to make it simple.
# the exchange (or 24 exchange, plan, or 29 spill) is removed
# so it only has a single direct diversion
#
# this dataset can successfully estimated baseflows to an xbm file
# using the example-0-6-b rsp file
# and can successfuly run in simulation mode with example-0-6.rsp
#
# the example 0 series has a network that is fairly small and simple,
#   but complex enough to host various kinds of structures later,
#   and has enough variability to be good for testing
# drawings of and notes about the network can be found in the series
#   of files with names like example-0-6-doc.*
#
