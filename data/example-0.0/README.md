this is statemod example dataset 0-0
this is the base (0th) network dateset for the example 0 series
  of statemod data sets
example X-Y means the example X series, the Yth version
usually the 0th version has no diversions or rules of any kind,
  and the baseflow nodes are all stream gage nodes
there are no historical diversions, therefore the .xbm = .rim = .rih
the example 0 series has a network that is simple,
  but large enough to host any structures and rules
  in later versions,
  and has enough variability to be good for testing
drawings of and notes about the network can be found in the series
  of files with names like example-0-0-doc.*
