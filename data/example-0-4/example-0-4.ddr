# Example 0-4
# example-0-4.ddr;  Direct Diversion Right for StateMod Example 0-4
#
# this is the fourth network dateset for the example 0 series
#   of statemod data sets
# example X.Y means the example X series, the Yth version
#
# this dataset is the same as 0-3, except the flows/demand/etc are multipled by 100
# to make it easier to detect conversion problems
# ithe main moving part is a direct exchange from the jr DD1 water right to
# an upstream acct plan (type 11) via op rule 24.
#
# this dataset can successfully estimated baseflows to an xbm file
# using the example-0-4-b rsp file
# and can successfuly run in simulation mode with example-0-4.rsp
#
# the example 0 series has a network that is fairly small and simple,
#   but complex enough to host various kinds of structures later,
#   and has enough variability to be good for testing
# drawings of and notes about the network can be found in the series
#   of files with names like example-0-4-doc.*#
