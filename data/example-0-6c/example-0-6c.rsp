# StateMod Response File for example 0-6c
#
# this is the sixth network dateset for the example 0 series
#   of statemod data sets
# example X.Y means the example X series, the Yth version
#
# This dataset is similar to 0-6b, except changed DD1 to be 80% consumptive.
#   Now DD1 should be curtailed by the downstream sr. right at DD2.
#
# this dataset can successfully estimated baseflows to an xbm file
#   using the example-0-6c-b rsp file
#   and can successfuly run in simulation mode with example-0-6c.rsp
#
# the example 0 series has a network that is fairly small and simple,
#   but complex enough to host various kinds of structures later,
#   and has enough variability to be good for testing
# drawings of and notes about the network can be found in the series
#   of files with names like example-0-6c-doc.*
