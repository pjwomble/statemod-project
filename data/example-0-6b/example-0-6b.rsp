# StateMod Response File for example 0-6b
#
# this is the sixth network dateset for the example 0 series
#   of statemod data sets
# example X.Y means the example X series, the Yth version
#
# this dataset is similar to 0-6a, except moved the DD1 return flows to
#   the same node as the DD2 diversion senior right.  Because DD1 only consumes
#   20% of 2000 (400 af) which leaves 5600 in the river for DD2, it should be
#   able to divert both rights and get a full supply
#
# this dataset can successfully estimated baseflows to an xbm file
#   using the example-0-6b-b rsp file
#   and can successfuly run in simulation mode with example-0-6b.rsp
#
# the example 0 series has a network that is fairly small and simple,
#   but complex enough to host various kinds of structures later,
#   and has enough variability to be good for testing
# drawings of and notes about the network can be found in the series
#   of files with names like example-0-6b-doc.*
