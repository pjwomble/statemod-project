this is statemod example dataset 0-6b
this is the sixth network dateset for the example 0 series
  of statemod data sets
example X.Y means the example X series, the Yth version

this dataset is similar to 0-6a, except moved the DD1 return flows to
the same node as the DD2 diversion senior right.  Because DD1 only consumes
20% of 2000 (400 af) which leaves 5600 in the river for DD2, it should be
able to divert both rights and get a full supply

this dataset can successfully estimated baseflows to an xbm file
using the example-0-6b-b rsp file
and can successfuly run in simulation mode with example-0-6b.rsp

the example 0 series has a network that is fairly small and simple,
  but complex enough to host various kinds of structures later,
  and has enough variability to be good for testing
drawings of and notes about the network can be found in the series
  of files with names like example-0-6b-doc.*
