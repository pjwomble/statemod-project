# StateMod Response File for example 0-5g
#
# this is the fifth network dateset for the example 0 series
#   of statemod data sets
# example X.Y means the example X series, the Yth version
# 
# This dataset is similar to example 0-5f
# except the split plans are put on a separate upstream node
# from the destination diversion to see if it affects the
# behavior of the type 27 delivery rule.
# Added more nodes to the network
# 
# this dataset can successfully estimated baseflows to an xbm file
# using the example-0-5g-b rsp file
# and can successfuly run in simulation mode with example-0-5g.rsp
# 
# the example 0 series has a network that is fairly small and simple,
#   but complex enough to host various kinds of structures later,
#   and has enough variability to be good for testing
# drawings of and notes about the network can be found in the series
#   of files with names like example-0-5g-doc.*
