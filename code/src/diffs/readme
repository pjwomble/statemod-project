o2m - is the diff from Ray's original 13.00.01 to the latest master branch 14.00.03
      mainly these are fixing small typos and compiler complaints
      some major upgrades are in there, but hopefully not in the same files!
o2n - is the diff from Ray's original 13.00.01 to Ray's new type 45 changes
      these would include only his changes necessary for the type 45 update
m2n - is the diff from the latest master branch 14.00.03 to Ray's new type 45 files
      these will include some unwanted retrogrades back to broken code, so ignore these!
